## Analysis :

YouTube titles affects a lot for people to view the video. Here, we can analyse some kind of words that can be used so our video title becomes interesting. This code is also able to get what each country preferred genre is. In this code, I try to implement USA, Canada, Japan and Korea trending videos in 2017 and 2018.
